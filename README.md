# Foo-rum

This is a dummy app which has auth pages and home page where users can post and see their feed.

## Steps to Setup

```
Note: Please install nvm and pnpm for smoother setup.
```

1. `nvm use` to select required node version
2. `pnpm install` to install all the dependencies
3. `pnpm dev` to run the dev server (`pnpm build` to make a production build)

## Dummy user creds (No real auth has been setup)
```
demo@example.com / password123
test@user.com / testpass
```
